Nothing much here, just the code for TylerRajotte.github.io

To-Do:
- Add Scrollmagic top tool bar

- Make it so that text scales with viewport size
- Devise better text scaling

-Setup JavaScript or maybe CSS to pick down scaled images for devices that don't need the absolute max resolution so load times can be cut down significantly

- Setup Content pages or content view with JavaScript
- Setup other pages with previous content and other work
- Sort out mobile view and maybe remove mobile detect script
